== Header sequence ==

1	Version/Variant 1
D|N	Are diagonal moves allowed or not allowed?
~	End of header

== The elements ==

X	This is a locked field. You cannot place a stone there
3	This is a space with a red (30) stone.
2	This is a space with a yellow (20) stone.
1	This is a space with a green (10) stone.
E	This is a space.
*	This is handled like a locked field (X), but it has only the half width.
	This is necessary if you want to have a playground in a triangle shape.

== Special chars between the elements ==

>	The next element (which may not be X, * or a line end) is the area,
	where the last stone has to go to.
!	Between the first and the second line of the matrix, there has to
	be an "!". This is neccessary that the width can be detected.
	There has to be one "!" in the file. Also, the level has to be complete.
	If there are 9 elements before "!", then the level is only valid,
	if there are 0, 9, 18, 27, 36, ... elements after the "!".

== Hints ==

Carriage-Return (CR) and Line-feeds (LF) are optional, but they are recommended because
of a better overview.
